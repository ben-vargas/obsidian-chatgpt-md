# AGENTS.md

AI coding-agent instructions for **chatgpt-md**.

## Project overview

`chatgpt-md` is an Obsidian community plugin that brings LLM workflows into markdown notes. It supports:

- Chat interactions directly inside Obsidian notes.
- Multiple providers: OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, Z.AI, and compatible APIs.
- Per-note configuration through YAML frontmatter.
- Streaming responses.
- Human-approved AI tool calls for vault and web search workflows.

The plugin is TypeScript, bundled by esbuild, and runs inside the Obsidian plugin runtime.

## Validation commands

Use npm for validation unless the project explicitly changes package-manager policy.

```bash
npm run build
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run lint
```

Current lint may report complexity/length warnings. Do not treat existing warnings as task blockers unless your change adds new warnings.

## Current architecture

### Entry point

- `src/main.ts`
  - Creates the `ServiceContainer`.
  - Loads and migrates settings.
  - Registers commands.
  - Starts background model initialization.

### Dependency wiring

- `src/core/ServiceContainer.ts`
  - Explicit constructor-injection container.
  - Creates services once per plugin load.
  - Exposes an `aiProviderService()` factory for per-request AI provider instances.
  - Do **not** add string-based service lookup or a framework-style DI system.

### Commands

- `src/Commands/*Handler.ts`
  - Command handlers orchestrate services.
  - Registration helpers live in `src/Commands/CommandRegistrar.ts`.
  - Command contracts live in `src/Commands/CommandHandler.ts`.

### Services

- `src/Services/Providers/ProviderRegistry.ts`
  - Operational source of truth for provider IDs, defaults, credentials, URLs, adapters, and AI SDK factories.
  - Keep user-facing settings copy in the settings schema and protocol differences in adapters.

- `src/Services/AiProviderService.ts`
  - Current facade for AI calls, streaming, provider selection, title inference, and tool-call handling.
  - Large; prefer incremental extraction of pure helpers over rewrites.

- `src/Services/Adapters/*Adapter.ts`
  - Provider-specific behavior such as model listing, auth headers, system-message role, API path suffix, and tool support.
  - New provider-specific API differences belong here.

- `src/Services/SettingsService.ts`
  - Loads/saves plugin settings.
  - Runs migrations.
  - Resolves effective frontmatter config with global settings and agent frontmatter.

- `src/Services/ToolService.ts`
  - Registers tool definitions.
  - Executes tools after approval.
  - Formats/filters tool results.
  - Preserve human approval flows when editing this area.

- `src/Services/MessageService.ts`, `EditorService.ts`, `FileService.ts`, `TemplateService.ts`
  - Editor/message/file/template coordination.

### Views and utilities

- `src/Views/*`
  - Obsidian modals and settings UI.
  - Keep business logic out of views when practical.

- `src/Utilities/*`
  - Stateless helpers. Prefer adding pure behavior here when no service state is needed.

### Models and types

- `src/Models/*`
  - Internal config/message/tool models.

- `src/Types/*`
  - Cross-cutting service/provider contracts.

## Important implementation rules

### DRY

Operational provider metadata is centralized in `ProviderRegistry`. Search before changing provider behavior because user-facing settings fields, migrations, documentation, and adapter-specific protocol logic remain separate concerns.

```bash
rg "openai|anthropic|gemini|openrouter|ollama|lmstudio|zai" src
```

### KISS

- Prefer small pure helper extraction over large rewrites.
- Keep command handlers thin.
- Keep `ServiceContainer` explicit.
- Do not introduce a new DI framework or generic plugin system unless explicitly requested.

### YAGNI

- Do not build broad abstractions for hypothetical providers/tools.
- Add the minimum structure needed for the current change.
- Avoid heavy dependencies for simple parsing, formatting, or logging.

## Adding a command

1. Add/update a handler in `src/Commands/`.
2. Implement the appropriate interface from `src/Commands/CommandHandler.ts`.
3. Register it in `src/main.ts` using `CommandRegistrar` where possible.
4. Keep command logic limited to orchestration and user-visible status.

## Adding provider behavior today

The project uses a unified `AiProviderService`, a provider registry, and provider adapters:

1. Add an adapter in `src/Services/Adapters/` implementing `ProviderAdapter`.
2. Add the provider ID/type in `src/Constants.ts`.
3. Add defaults in `src/Services/DefaultConfigs.ts` and persisted fields in `src/Models/Config.ts`.
4. Add one operational definition in `src/Services/Providers/ProviderRegistry.ts`.
5. Add provider-specific settings fields to `src/Views/settingsSchema.ts`.
6. Add/update migrations, docs, routing tests, and registry completeness tests.

## Working with settings/frontmatter

Effective chat config is assembled from multiple layers. Preserve this priority unless explicitly changing behavior:

1. provider defaults
2. default chat frontmatter from settings
3. global plugin settings
4. referenced agent frontmatter/body
5. note frontmatter

When adding settings, update:

- `ChatGPT_MDSettings`
- `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
- settings UI schema/rendering
- migrations if old data needs conversion
- docs

## Working with tools

Tool calls may expose vault or web data. Never bypass approval modals or approval filtering. Keep tool result formatting deterministic and testable.

## Logging and secrets

- Do not log API keys.
- Avoid logging full prompts or vault content by default.
- Prefer debug-gated logging for request/stream internals.

## Generated files

- `main.js` is a build/release artifact. Do not edit it by hand.
- Do not commit coverage output, `.DS_Store`, logs, or local editor state.
