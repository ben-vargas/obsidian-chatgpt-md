ollama pull llama3.2    # Download a model
ollama list               # See what you have
```

In your note:
```yaml
---
model: ollama@llama3.2
---
```

## 🎯 What You Can Do

### Chat About Anything

Write a question, get an answer. Simple.

```markdown
user:: What makes a good daily note?

assistant:: Great daily notes are:
- **Specific** — "Had coffee with Sarah" not "Met a friend"
- **Actionable** — Include next steps or open questions
- **Connected** — Link to related ideas and people
```

### Reference Your Other Notes

This is where it gets magical. Use `[[wiki links]]` and AI reads those notes too:

```markdown
user:: Based on my [[Meeting Notes]] and [[Project Ideas]],
what should I focus on this week?
```

AI reads your linked notes and gives you a contextual answer. No more copy-pasting context.

### Create AI Agents

Make AI personas for different tasks:

```markdown
# agents/WritingCoach.md
---
model: openai@gpt-4.1-mini
temperature: 0.8
---
You are a supportive writing coach. Help the user:
- Clarify their ideas with questions
- Suggest improvements without being harsh
- Celebrate their progress
```

Apply with "Choose Agent" command. Switch between agents instantly.

### Let AI Search Your Vault

Enable in Settings → Tool Calling. Then:

```markdown
user:: What have I written about machine learning?
```

AI: "I'd like to search your vault."
You: Approve ✓
AI: "Found 5 notes. Here's what you've written..."
You: Select what to share ✓

**You're always in control.** AI only sees what you approve.

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: How do I actually use this?**

A: Open any note. Write something. Press `Cmd+P`, type "chat", hit Enter. Watch AI respond in your note.

**Q: Can I use my existing notes?**

A: Yes! Just add a frontmatter block at the top with your settings, then use `[[wiki links]]` to reference other notes.

**Q: Which local model should I use?**

A: `llama3.2` is great for general use. `deepseek-r1:7b` for reasoning. Try a few and see what works for you.

**Q: Is my data private?**

A: With OpenAI/Anthropic, your messages go to their servers. With Ollama/LM Studio, everything stays on your computer. Your choice.
